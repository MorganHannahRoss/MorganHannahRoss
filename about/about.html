      <p>
        I'm Morgan, from Tāmaki Makaurau. Currently, I live Whangarei Heads.
        <br /><br />
        My fascination with computers goes back to my early years; it was only a
        matter of time before I found my way into the tech world. Despite this,
        the prospect of a career in this field used to intimidate me. Overcoming
        imposter syndrome has been a personal challenge, and I often find myself
        adopting a 'fake it till you make it' mentality when it starts to loom.
        <br /><br />
        I've found my way to Dev Academy after my previous education provider
        faced liquidation, an unpleasant turn of events considering I was three
        terms into my two-year diploma. Instead of dwelling on the setback, I've
        chosen to reframe the situation, asking myself, "What if it was a gift?"
        With this perspective, I've pivoted, encouraged by friends, university
        teachers, and fellow coders who believe this is the place to gain
        real-world experience and prepare for a career. <br /><br />
        In my past roles, I've navigated diverse experiences. Previously, I
        approved surgeries for an insurance company using softphone software via
        a web browser, which I found really cool. Before that, I provided tech
        support for a telecommunications company, engaging with customers via a
        call center to troubleshoot technical issues on Siebel software, often
        with the aid of outdated softphone software. Assisting physical shop
        sales teams, business customers, and clients, and let's just say I've
        spent my fair share of time getting yelled at on the phone … quite a few
        years. But I also shared every emotion over the phone with a stranger,
        from grief to growth, in turn growing my perspective of the world too.

        <br /><br />
        Over the course of my career journey, I've also worn the hats of a
        barista and a bartender, embracing opportunities for growth and
        evolution. With my varied interests, including watching a* NFT computer
        game come to life as a community manager just for fun, I honestly feel
        like I am all over the place... but I truly believe I'm in the right
        place that I need to be right now.
