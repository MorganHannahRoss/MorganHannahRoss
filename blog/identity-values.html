    <h2>Ethical Decisions</h2>
    <p>In a previous role, I encountered a situation where a client inadvertently received access to confidential information. My ethical decision-making process involved weighing values like integrity, responsibility, and accountability. I chose to promptly report the incident to the relevant authorities and took measures to prevent any potential misuse. Reflecting on this decision now, I still stand by it as it aligns with my core values of honesty and ethical conduct.</p>
    <h2>Cultural Influences</h2>
    <p>Growing up in New Zealand's mix of cultures has really influenced who I am. My family, which comes from different backgrounds, taught me to respect and appreciate our cultural differences. This made me value things like respect, empathy, and being open-minded. Traveling to different places has added to this, making me more adaptable and understanding in diverse situations. So, being open to different perspectives has become a big part of who I am and has helped me grow.</p>
    <h2>Personal Strengths</h2>
    <p>One of my strengths lies in effective communication. This skill has been honed through various roles, from customer service to team collaboration. I believe clear communication fosters positive relationships and facilitates collaborative learning. Additionally, my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities empower me to approach challenges systematically, contributing to effective decision-making.</p>
    <h2>My Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      While I acknowledge the importance of time management, it remains an area where I seek improvement. In a fast-paced learning environment, optimizing my time efficiently is crucial. I recognize the potential impact on my learning journey and career development. To address this limitation, I am actively exploring strategies such as time-blocking and prioritization.

    <h2>Collaboration Struggles</h2>
    <p>In my previous job at a call center, I faced a challenging situation where I needed urgent approvals for surgeries. However, there was resistance and delays in obtaining them from time to time, adding tension to the time-sensitive nature of the issue. I used strategies like clear communication, documentation, and consistent follow-ups to convey the urgency with both team members and the clients. While these tactics were somewhat effective, the experience prompted me to reflect on the importance of understanding others' perspectives, potentially escalating the matter to higher authorities, and building positive relationships in advance for smoother processes during crucial times. This situation highlighted the need for adaptability and the importance of exploring diverse strategies tailored to the unique dynamics of the work environment.</p>
