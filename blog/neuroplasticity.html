      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
          people.</strong
        >

        <br /><br />
        Understanding how the brain can change, known as neuroplasticity, is
        really helpful for people. It shows us that our brains can adapt and
        grow, which is crucial in various situations. For example, if someone
        has a brain injury, knowing about neuroplasticity can guide their
        recovery process. It also helps people facing learning difficulties, as
        strategies can be developed to improve memory and learning skills.
        Embracing neuroplasticity means we can keep learning and adapting
        throughout our lives. In terms of mental health, it shows that positive
        changes are possible through therapies and mindfulness. In education,
        students can use neuroplasticity to improve how they study and face
        challenges. It also helps us deal with stress, seeing it as a way to
        trigger positive changes. Overall, understanding neuroplasticity breaks
        the idea that our brains are fixed and encourages us to take an active
        role in keeping our brains healthy and sharp.

        >

        <br /><br />
        To boost your neuroplasticity, you can practice activities repeatedly.
        It's like working out your brain – the more you do it, the stronger it
        gets. Reviewing information in different ways and recalling memories
        helps too. Also, getting a good night's sleep, eating well, and using
        your imagination are great for keeping your brain flexible and
        adaptable. So, try to learn new things, challenge yourself, and stay
        curious!

        "Using fMRI scans of computer programmers as they read code, researchers
        have discovered that the complex language processing takes place in the
        left hemisphere in a part of the brain dedicated to logical
        reasoning"<br /><br />

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</strong>

        <br /><br />
        A growth mindset is a way of thinking that believes our abilities and
        intelligence can improve with effort, practice, and learning. It stands
        in contrast to a fixed mindset that assumes talents are unchangeable. A
        growth mindset is crucial because it helps us face challenges
        positively, bounce back from tough times, and keep improving.
        <br />
        The concept of a growth mindset, pioneered by psychologist Carol Dweck,
        revolves around the belief that abilities and intelligence can be
        developed through dedication, effort, and learning. This mindset is
        relevant in various aspects of life, influencing how we approach
        learning, handle setbacks, and strive for success.
        <br />
        Understanding that intelligence is not fixed but can change has
        important implications. It shapes how we view learning, our resilience
        in facing difficulties, and our overall approach to personal and
        professional development.
        <br /><br />
        <strong
          >In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for
          you?</strong
        >

        <br /><br />
        This idea of a growth mindset is important to me because, in 2019, I had
        a brain injury and I also have ADHD. Understanding that our intelligence
        isn't fixed reminds me of my own journey growing up, and also in
        overcoming challenges during recovery. It's not surprising, but it
        strengthens my belief in getting better each day.
        <br /><br />
        <strong
          >How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning
          journey?</strong
        >

        <br /><br />
        I will integrate it when learning how to code, and a growth mindset will
        be my guide. Instead of seeing problems as roadblocks, I'll treat them
        as chances to learn more. When things get tough, I won't give up. Daily
        practice, learning from mistakes, and setting small goals will be my way
        of embracing a growth mindset in coding.

        <em>“Confidence is just displayed ability.”</em> <br /><br />
        Put another way: “Prove it to yourself in small ways and you’ll develop
        the confidence that you can improve.” In other words, small wins
        repeated over time can lead to a growth mindset.”<br />

        <br />
        In addition, the book 'Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results'
        by James Clear is something I find valuable. <br />It is an
        easy-to-understand guide about how small changes can make a big
        difference. It delves into the science of habits, offering practical
        insights on how small changes can lead to significant
        transformations.<br /><br />
