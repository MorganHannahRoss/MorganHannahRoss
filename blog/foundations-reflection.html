        <h2>Reflection on Foundations Core Skills</h2>

        <h3>
          What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego
          due to the core learning?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I've learned that I have a tendency to be overly critical of myself,
            especially when facing challenges or setbacks. Through core
            learning, I've become more aware of this tendency and have started
            to practice self-compassion and growth mindset.
          </li>
          <li>
            Core learning has also helped me recognize the importance of active
            listening and understanding others' perspectives. I've realized that
            my ego can sometimes get in the way of truly empathizing with
            others, and I'm working on being more open-minded and empathetic in
            my interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, I've learned that my values play a significant role in
            shaping my decisions and actions. Understanding my core values has
            helped me stay true to myself and make choices aligned with what
            matters most to me.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
          What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
          and programming?
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Values</strong> guide our behavior and decision-making
            process, ensuring that we prioritize principles such as integrity,
            collaboration, and continuous improvement. In programming, aligning
            our actions with our values helps us create ethical and impactful
            solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Empathy</strong> allows us to understand the needs and
            perspectives of users, enabling us to develop user-centric software
            that meets their requirements effectively. Empathy also fosters
            collaboration within development teams, leading to better
            communication and teamwork.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-awareness</strong> helps us recognize our strengths,
            weaknesses, and biases, allowing us to leverage our strengths and
            address areas for improvement. In programming, self-awareness
            enables us to adapt to new technologies, seek help when needed, and
            continuously grow as developers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          The most surprising aspect of core learning for me was realizing how
          much our mindset and emotional intelligence impact our learning and
          problem-solving abilities. I hadn't fully appreciated the importance
          of these skills in programming before, but now I see how they can
          significantly influence our success in the field.
        </p>

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most challenging aspects of core learning was confronting
          my own biases and ego-driven behaviors. It's not easy to acknowledge
          our flaws and vulnerabilities, but doing so is crucial for personal
          growth and development. Additionally, learning to actively listen and
          empathize with others, especially when we disagree, required practice
          and patience.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
          focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Programming is not just about writing code; it's also about
          collaborating with others, understanding user needs, and solving
          complex problems. Core learning equips us with the interpersonal
          skills, emotional intelligence, and self-awareness necessary to thrive
          in the tech industry. Employers are looking for well-rounded
          individuals who can communicate effectively, work well in teams, and
          adapt to changing circumstances, making core skills essential for
          success in a web development Bootcamp course.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
          of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming
          instead? Justify your answer.
        </h3>
        <p>
          No, the time spent studying core learning does not feel like a waste
          of time. While programming skills are important, core learning
          enhances our ability to communicate, collaborate, and problem-solve
          effectively, making us more valuable assets in the tech industry.
          Additionally, developing self-awareness and emotional intelligence
          improves our overall well-being and resilience, enabling us to
          navigate challenges and setbacks with greater ease. Therefore, the
          investment in core learning is essential for our long-term success and
          fulfillment as developers.
