            <td>
              <strong
                >How accurate were your expectations of your learning needs and
                growth areas?</strong
              ><br />
              When I revisited my initial thoughts about my learning journey, I
              realised that while I had some idea of what I needed to learn,
              there were nuances I hadn't fully anticipated. While I expected
              technical challenges, I didn't foresee the extent to which my
              adaptability and problem-solving skills would be tested. Also, I
              underestimated the significance of interpersonal skills and
              collaboration in the bootcamp experience.<br /><br />

              <strong
                >Were there any surprises / did you learn new things about
                yourself?</strong
              ><br />
              Bootcamp was a journey filled with surprises and self-discovery.
              One of the most unexpected revelations was discovering my capacity
              for resilience and perseverance. I surprised myself by bouncing
              back from setbacks and remaining determined to overcome
              challenges. I learned that I can thrive in collaborative
              environments, finding joy and fulfillment in working closely with
              peers to solve problems and achieve shared goals. Also, I gained
              insights into my preferred learning styles and strategies,
              allowing me to tailor my approach moving forward.<br /><br />

              <strong
                >What challenges did you find in following your learning and
                wellbeing plan?</strong
              ><br />
              Following my learning and wellbeing plan presented various
              challenges, primarily related to time management and
              prioritisation. Balancing the demands of bootcamp with other
              commitments required careful planning and discipline. I often
              found myself stretched thin, struggling to allocate time
              effectively between studying, attending sessions, and taking care
              of personal responsibilities. Also, maintaining consistency in
              self-care practices amidst the intensity of bootcamp proved
              challenging at times. Despite these obstacles, I remained
              committed to my goals and sought support when needed to stay on
              track.<br /><br />

              <strong
                >What benefits did you experience from following your learning
                and wellbeing plan?</strong
              ><br />
              Despite all the challenges, following my learning and wellbeing
              plan yielded numerous benefits. Structuring my learning goals and
              tracking my progress kept me focused and motivated throughout the
              bootcamp journey. Having a clear roadmap helped me maintain a
              sense of direction and purpose, even during periods of uncertainty
              or difficulty when sick. Prioritising self-care and mental health
              contributed to my overall well-being and resilience, enabling me
              to sustain productivity and effectiveness despite the rigors of
              bootcamp. Overall, when adhering to my learning and wellbeing
              plan, i found it could facilitate personal and professional
              growth, equipping me with valuable skills to serve me beyond
              bootcamp.
