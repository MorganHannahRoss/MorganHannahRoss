                >How accurate were your expectations of your learning needs and
                growth areas?</strong
              ><br />
              When I revisited my initial thoughts about my learning journey, I
              realised that while I had some idea of what I needed to learn,
              there were nuances I hadn't fully anticipated. While I expected
              technical challenges, I didn't foresee the extent to which my
              adaptability and problem-solving skills would be tested. Also, I
              underestimated the significance of interpersonal skills and
              collaboration in the bootcamp experience.<br /><br />

              <strong
                >Were there any surprises / did you learn new things about
                yourself?</strong
              ><br />
              Bootcamp was a journey filled with surprises and self-discovery.
              One of the most unexpected revelations was discovering my capacity
              for resilience and perseverance. I surprised myself by bouncing
              back from setbacks and remaining determined to overcome
              challenges. I learned that I can thrive in collaborative
              environments, finding joy and fulfillment in working closely with
              peers to solve problems and achieve shared goals. Also, I gained
              insights into my preferred learning styles and strategies,
              allowing me to tailor my approach moving forward.<br /><br />

              <strong
                >What challenges did you find in following your learning and
                wellbeing plan?</strong
              ><br />
              Following my learning and wellbeing plan presented various
              challenges, primarily related to time management and
              prioritisation. Balancing the demands of bootcamp with other
              commitments required careful planning and discipline. I often
              found myself stretched thin, struggling to allocate time
              effectively between studying, attending sessions, and taking care
              of personal responsibilities. Also, maintaining consistency in
              self-care practices amidst the intensity of bootcamp proved
              challenging at times. Despite these obstacles, I remained
              committed to my goals and sought support when needed to stay on
              track.<br /><br />

              <strong
                >What benefits did you experience from following your learning
                and wellbeing plan?</strong
              ><br />
              Despite all the challenges, following my learning and wellbeing
              plan yielded numerous benefits. Structuring my learning goals and
              tracking my progress kept me focused and motivated throughout the
              bootcamp journey. Having a clear roadmap helped me maintain a
              sense of direction and purpose, even during periods of uncertainty
              or difficulty when sick. Prioritising self-care and mental health
              contributed to my overall well-being and resilience, enabling me
              to sustain productivity and effectiveness despite the rigors of
              bootcamp. Overall, when adhering to my learning and wellbeing
              plan, i found it could facilitate personal and professional
              growth, equipping me with valuable skills to serve me beyond
              bootcamp.

            This was an insightful deep dive into listening and empathy. Through
            engaging discussions and activities, I gained valuable insights into
            the importance of active engagement and genuine understanding in
            human interactions. Understanding empathy as more than just
            acknowledging emotions and recognising the role of listening in
            fostering connection and trust were key takeaways. Additionally,
            discussions on trust elements and relationship-building highlighted
            the significance of these skills in professional settings. Learning
            about self-compassion and growth mindset provided a supportive
            framework for approaching challenges with resilience and optimism,
            fueling my determination to persevere and continue learning. I
            discovered that I learn best through active engagement and hands-on
            activities, which allow me to internalise concepts more effectively.
            During this week, I developed skills in active listening, empathy,
            and relationship-building, which I hope to further enhance in my
            future interactions in the workplace. Learning about self-compassion
            and growth mindset has supported my learning by providing me with a
            positive outlook on challenges and setbacks, allowing me to approach
            them with resilience.

            This week's activities deepened my understanding of human skills.
            Engaging in discussions and reflections on giving & receiving
            feedback provided some valuable insights into effective
            communication and relationship building. Exploring appreciative
            feedback and making requests highlighted the importance of specific
            and kind communication in creating positive interactions. These
            sessions reinforced the significance of empathy, active listening,
            and trust in creating strong relationships, both personally and
            professionally. Through these activities, I learned that
            constructive feedback and open communication are essential for
            personal and professional growth. I aim to continue developing these
            skills to foster a supportive and collaborative work environment.
            Learning about self-compassion and growth mindset has encouraged me
            to embrace feedback as an opportunity for growth, rather than
            viewing it as criticism.

            The focus of this week's activities shifted towards self-reflection
            and skill development in conflict resolution. Through interactive
            sessions and guided exercises, I gained insights into identifying
            and addressing conflicts constructively. Explored strategies for
            navigating challenging conversations and fostering understanding
            emphasised the importance of empathy and effective communication.
            Also, discussions on self-awareness and perspective-taking
            highlighted the role of personal growth in conflict resolution. This
            deepened my appreciation of the value of approaching conflicts with
            empathy and open-mindedness. This week, I discovered that conflict
            resolution requires active listening, empathy, and a willingness to
            understand different perspectives. These skills will be invaluable
            in my future interactions in the workplace, as they contribute to
            fostering a positive and collaborative environment. Learning about
            self-compassion and growth mindset has helped me approach conflicts
            with patience and understanding, enabling me to find constructive
            solutions.

            As we delved into discussions on wellbeing, I found myself
            reflecting on the importance of holistic self-care in maintaining
            overall wellness. Exploring the components of a wellbeing plan and
            revisiting personal goals provided an opportunity for introspection
            and goal-setting. This week was really all about mental, emotional,
            and physical wellbeing, emphasising the importance of balance and
            self-care in navigating the demands of bootcamp. Through these
            activities, I learned the importance of prioritising self-care and
            setting boundaries to maintain overall wellbeing. These skills will
            be crucial in managing stress and maintaining balance in the
            workplace. Learning about self-compassion and growth mindset has
            encouraged me to prioritise my wellbeing and approach challenges
            with a positive attitude.

            the complexities of human interactions and the impact of unconscious
            biases on relationships and decision-making. Engaging in discussions
            and activities aimed at promoting inclusivity and understanding

            The opportunity to engage in deep discussions, self-reflection, and
            skill development over the past seven weeks has been invaluable.
            From exploring empathy and trust to navigating conflict and

            opportunities for growth. I am grateful for the guidance and support
