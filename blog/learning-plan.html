      <p><strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong></p>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to establish a fulfilling career as a skilled and
        adaptable developer, contributing my solutions to real-world challenges
        and continuously growing in the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
          learning:</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of learning, my strengths lie in adaptability, effective
        communication, and a strong work ethic. However, I recognize that
        sometimes I tend to overthink tasks, leading to potential delays in
        decision-making.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
          developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I aim to develop strong non-technical core skills, including effective
        teamwork, active listening, and leadership. These skills are crucial for
        collaboration and success in any professional setting.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme?
          <br />
          This should include: <br />* An explanation of how you will manage
          yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
          Facilitators and industry/community representatives <br />* What you
          will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        To manage my workload, I commit to effective time management, regular
        breaks, and open communication with both learners and facilitators. When
        feeling overwhelmed, I'll proactively seek support from peers or
        facilitators, ensuring a healthy and balanced learning experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
          way?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I will seek help in a timely manner through designated channels such as
        asking questions during meeting, participating in group discussions on
        discord, and reaching out to facilitators through our scheduled
        check-ins.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong
          >A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        From the Facilitation team, I expect guidance, constructive feedback,
        and a supportive learning environment. Clear communication and regular
        check-ins will be valuable for my progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
          committed to other things? <br />
          - For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school
          drop-offs. It's important to plan these in. Your Facilitator will
          review your Learning Plan at the end of this Sprint</strong

      </p>
      <p>
        I will be relocating houses as the property I am currently renting is
        now up for sale. I will communicate any potential disruptions in advance
        and appreciate understanding during this transition period
