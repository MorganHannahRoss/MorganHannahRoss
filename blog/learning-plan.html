        I aim to develop strong non-technical core skills, including effective
        teamwork, active listening, and leadership. These skills are crucial for

          yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
          Facilitators and industry/community representatives <br />* What you
          will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong

      <p>
        To manage my workload, I commit to effective time management, regular
        breaks, and open communication with both learners and facilitators. When
        feeling overwhelmed, I'll proactively seek support from peers or
        facilitators, ensuring a healthy and balanced learning experience.

      </p>
      <p>
        I will seek help in a timely manner through designated channels such as
        asking questions during meeting, participating in group discussions on
        discord, and reaching out to facilitators through our scheduled
        check-ins.
