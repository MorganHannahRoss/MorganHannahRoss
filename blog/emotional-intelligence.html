        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          In coding, EQ is the ability to understand and manage emotions
          effectively while working on software development projects. It
          involves being aware of one's emotions, recognizing them in others,
          and using that awareness to navigate collaboration, problem-solving,
          and communication in a technical environment.
        </p>

        <h2>How is EQ different from IQ in Coding?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ differs from IQ by focusing on emotional and interpersonal aspects
          rather than analytical or problem-solving abilities. While IQ measures
          cognitive skills crucial for coding, EQ is essential for effective
          teamwork, communication, and managing interpersonal dynamics within a
          development team.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is EQ important for Developers?</h2>
        <p>
          For coding developers, EQ is vital for successful collaboration,
          teamwork, and project management. It helps in handling feedback
          positively, resolving conflicts, and fostering a positive work
          environment. High EQ enables developers to communicate complex
          technical concepts clearly, understand user needs empathetically, and
          contribute positively to team dynamics, ultimately leading to more
          effective and harmonious software development processes.
