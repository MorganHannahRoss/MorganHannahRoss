      <h2>Overcoming Simple Code Problems</h2>
      <p>
        In software development, I faced a challenge implementing FizzBuzz logic
        for an array in JavaScript. Despite its apparent simplicity, my initial
        attempts were marked by frustration as the code didn't behave as
        anticipated. Determined to independently conquer the challenge, I
        engaged in an exhaustive search across various resources, eventually
        finding the missing piece on developer.mozilla.org. This experience
        underscored the importance of precise searches and the humility to seek
        guidance when lost in unfamiliar coding territories.

        />
        <br />
        <br />
        However, not every coding scenario revolves around obstacles. On another
        occasion, I faced the classic FizzBuzz problem, a well-known puzzle in
        the Dev Academy community. This time, the solution unfolded with more
        systematic elegance. Employing a meticulous approach, I gained insights
        by reviewing the pre-written tests on the test page. The satisfaction I
        got from this smooth problem-solving process revealed the idea that
        optimal solutions often require thinking outside the box and challenging
        conventional expectations I originally had.

      <h2>
        Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pseudocode: </strong>This is something I find imperative to do
          in order to comprehend the coding process thoroughly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trying something: </strong>I definitely engage in this process
          frequently, learning from both successes and failures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rubber ducky method: </strong>I consider it very helpful,
          although sometimes more effective when coupled with collaborative
          discussions with peers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reading error messages: </strong>I acknowledge that I could
          use some more practice in deciphering error messages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Console.logging: </strong>I feel confident about using it, but
          I could probably incorporate it more strategically.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Googling: </strong>I consider myself in the top tier of this
          skill set, effectively leveraging search engines to address coding
          challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asking your peers for help: </strong>I definitely ask for
          assistance when needed, recognizing the value of diverse perspectives
          in overcoming challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Asking coaches for help: </strong>I haven't had the chance to
          engage with coaching resources yet, but I remain open to leveraging
          their expertise when necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improving your process with reflection: </strong>Definitely a
          skill I've improved during this course, as it wasn't something I used
          to prioritize.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made
        you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Reflecting on instances where I hesitated to seek help, it often
        revolved around the fear that the issue might be embarrassingly simple â€“
        a mere typo, as it usually turned out. The hesitation sprang from a
        sense that I should have reviewed my work before interrupting someone
        else's workflow. There's a constant underlying concern about wasting
        their time or disrupting their focus for me. However, if I genuinely
        find myself stuck, I've learned to overcome this reluctance and seek
        help. Additionally, taking a short break for a clearer perspective has
        proven effective, often revealing the solution upon returning with a
        fresh head.
